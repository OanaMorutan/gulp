# What are Tasks

Each gulp task is an asynchronous JavaScript function - a function that accepts a callback or returns a stream, promise, observable, etc ([more on that later][node-async]). Due to some platform limitations, synchronous tasks aren’t supported, though there is a pretty nifty [alternative][async-await-sync-tasks].

## Exporting

Tasks can be considered **public** or **private**.

* **Public tasks** are exported from your gulpfile, which allows them to be run by the `gulp` command.
* **Private tasks** are made to be used internally, usually used as part of `series()` or `parallel()` composition.

A private task looks and acts like any other task, but an end-user can’t ever execute it independently.  To register a task publicly, export it from your gulpfile.

```js
const { series } = require('gulp');

// The `clean` function is not exported so it can be considered a private task.
// It can still be used within the `series()` composition.
function clean(cb) {
  // body omitted
  cb();
}

// The `build` function is exported so it is public and can be run with the `gulp` command.
// It can also be used within the `series()` composition.
function build(cb) {
  // body omitted
  cb();
}

exports.build = build;
exports.default = series(clean, build);
```

<small>In the past, `task()` was used to register your functions as tasks. While that API is still available, exporting should be the primary registration mechanism, except in edge cases where exports won’t work.</small>

## Compose tasks

Gulp provides two powerful composition methods, `series()` and `parallel()`, allowing individual tasks to be composed into larger operations. Both methods accept any number of task functions or composed operations.  `series()` and `parallel()` can be nested within themselves or each other to any depth.


To have your tasks execute in order, use the `series()` method.
```js
const { series } = require('gulp');

function transpile(cb) {
  // body omitted
  cb();
}

function bundle(cb) {
  // body omitted
  cb();
}

exports.build = series(transpile, bundle);
```

For tasks to run at maximum concurrency, combine them with the `parallel()` method.
```js
const { parallel } = require('gulp');

function javascript(cb) {
  // body omitted
  cb();
}

function css(cb) {
  // body omitted
  cb();
}

exports.build = parallel(javascript, css);
```

Tasks are composed immediately when either `series()` or `parallel()` is called.  This allows variation in the composition instead of conditional behavior inside individual tasks.

```js
const { series } = require('gulp');

function minify(cb) {
  // body omitted
  cb();
}


function transpile(cb) {
  // body omitted
  cb();
}

function livereload(cb) {
  // body omitted
  cb();
}

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  exports.build = series(transpile, minify);
} else {
  exports.build = series(transpile, livereload);
}
```

`series()` and `parallel()` can be nested to any arbitrary depth.

```js
const { series, parallel } = require('gulp');

function clean(cb) {
  // body omitted
  cb();
}

function cssTranspile(cb) {
  // body omitted
  cb();
}

function cssMinify(cb) {
  // body omitted
  cb();
}

function jsTranspile(cb) {
  // body omitted
  cb();
}

function jsBundle(cb) {
  // body omitted
  cb();
}

function jsMinify(cb) {
  // body omitted
  cb();
}

function publish(cb) {
  // body omitted
  cb();
}

exports.build = series(
  clean,
  parallel(
    cssTranspile,
    series(jsTranspile, jsBundle)
  ),
  parallel(cssMinify, jsMinify),
  publish
);
```

When a composed operation is run, each task will be executed every time it was referenced.  For example, a `clean` task referenced before two different tasks would be run twice and lead to undesired results.  Tasks can be wrapped with the [async-once][async-once] module if this **(not recommended)** pattern is needed.

```js
// This pattern is NOT recommended but some edge cases might require it.
const { series } = require('gulp');
const once = require('async-once');

const clean = once(function(cb) {
  // body omitted
  cb();
});

const css = series(clean, function(cb) {
  // body omitted
  cb();
});

const javascript = series(clean, function(cb) {
  // body omitted
  cb();
})

exports.build = series(css, javascript);
```
